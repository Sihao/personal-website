    heading: About me
    text: "I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Vaziri Lab at The Rockefeller University in New York City where I am studying large scale neural dynamics in vivo during sensory processing using advanced multi-photon imaging techniques. Previously, I completed my PhD at Imperial College London studying complex sound representation in the brain. My work investigated the receptive field properties of both astrocytes and neurons in the auditory cortex. I also examined how the inclusion of biological properties into artificial object recognition systems improves performance in low-data and adverserial regimes."
